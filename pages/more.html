                In the mid-1930s, Pauling, strongly influenced by the biologically oriented funding priorities
                of the Rockefeller Foundation's Warren Weaver, decided to strike out into new areas of interest.
                Although Pauling's early interest had focused almost exclusively on inorganic molecular structures,
                he had occasionally thought about molecules of biological importance, in part because of Caltech's
                growing strength in biology. Pauling interacted with such great biologists as Thomas Hunt Morgan,
                Theodosius Dobzhanski, Calvin Bridges and Alfred Sturtevant.[54] His early work in this area included
                studies of the structure of hemoglobin with his student Charles D. Coryell. He demonstrated that the
                hemoglobin molecule changes structure when it gains or loses an oxygen molecule. As a result of this observation,
                he decided to conduct a more thorough study of protein structure in general. He returned to his earlier use of X-ray
                diffraction analysis. But protein structures were far less amenable to this technique than the crystalline minerals of his former work.
                The best X-ray pictures of proteins in the 1930s had been made by the British crystallographer William Astbury, but when Pauling tried,
                in 1937, to account for Astbury's observations quantum mechanically, he could not. <br>
                It took eleven years for Pauling to explain the problem: his mathematical analysis was correct, but Astbury's pictures were taken in
                such a way that the protein molecules were tilted from their expected positions. Pauling had formulated a model for the structure of
                hemoglobin in which atoms were arranged in a helical pattern, and applied this idea to proteins in general.
                In 1951, based on the structures of amino acids and peptides and the planar nature of the peptide bond, Pauling,
                Robert Corey and Herman Branson correctly proposed the alpha helix and beta sheet as the primary structural motifs in protein secondary
                structure.This work exemplified Pauling's ability to think unconventionally; central to the structure was the unorthodox assumption
                that one turn of the helix may well contain a non-integer number of amino acid residues; for the alpha helix it is 3.7 amino acid residues per turn.
                Pauling then proposed that deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was a triple helix; his model contained several basic mistakes, including a proposal
                of neutral phosphate groups, an idea that conflicted with the acidity of DNA. Sir Lawrence Bragg had been disappointed that Pauling had won the race
                to find the alpha helix structure of proteins. Bragg's team had made a fundamental error in making their models of protein by not recognizing the planar
                nature of the peptide bond. When it was learned at the Cavendish Laboratory that Pauling was working on molecular models of the structure of DNA, James
                Watson and Francis Crick were allowed to make a molecular model of DNA. They later benefited from unpublished data from Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin
                at King's College which showed evidence for a helix and planar base stacking along the helix axis. Early in 1953 Watson and Crick proposed a correct structure
                for the DNA double helix. Pauling later cited several reasons to explain how he had been misled about the structure of DNA, among them misleading density data
                and the lack of high quality X-ray diffraction photographs. During the time Pauling was researching the problem, Rosalind Franklin in England was creating the
                world's best images. They were key to Watson's and Crick's success. Pauling did not see them before devising his mistaken DNA structure, although his assistant
                Robert Corey did see at least some of them, while taking Pauling's place at a summer 1952 protein conference in England. Pauling had been prevented from attending
                because his passport was withheld by the State Department on suspicion that he had Communist sympathies. This led to the legend that Pauling missed the structure
                of DNA because of the politics of the day (this was at the start of the McCarthy period in the United States). Politics did not play a critical role. Not only did
                Corey see the images at the time, but Pauling himself regained his passport within a few weeks and toured English laboratories well before writing his DNA paper.
                He had ample opportunity to visit Franklin's lab and see her work, but chose not to.
                Pauling also studied enzyme reactions and was among the first to point out that enzymes bring about reactions by stabilizing the transition state of the reaction,
                a view which is central to understanding their mechanism of action. He was also among the first scientists to postulate that the binding of antibodies to antigens
                would be due to a complementarity between their structures. Along the same lines, with the physicist turned biologist Max Delbr√ºck, he wrote an early paper arguing
                that DNA replication was likely to be due to complementarity, rather than similarity, as suggested by a few researchers. This was made clear in the model of the
                structure of DNA that Watson and Crick discovered.</p>
